# Comparing ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet for Stock Forecasting 

This project evaluates traditional (ARIMA), machine learning (LSTM), and modern forecasting models (Prophet) in predicting historical stock prices for Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). Using data sourced from Yahoo Finance via yfinance, the study compares model accuracy (MAE, RMSE), computational efficiency, and adaptability to market volatility. The repository includes code for data collection, preprocessing, model training, backtesting, and an interactive dashboard. Results identify the optimal model for stable vs. volatile stocks, providing actionable insights for traders and researchers
