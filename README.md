# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Hybrid-Time-Series-Models

This project aims to develop a hybrid stock price prediction model using ARIMA (statistical model) and LSTM (deep learning model) to improve the accuracy of real-time stock market forecasts. By combining statistical and deep learning techniques, the model will analyze historical stock data and generate real-time predictions to assist traders and investors in making informed financial decisions.

The project includes data collection, model training, and real-time deployment, with predictions visualized through an interactive dashboard. This system will help users track market trends, analyze stock movements, and assess prediction accuracy, making it useful for algorithmic trading, investment strategies, and financial risk management.
