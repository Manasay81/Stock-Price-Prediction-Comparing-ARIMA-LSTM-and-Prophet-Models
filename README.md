# Comparing ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet Models for Stock Price Forecasting: AAPL and TSLA Case Study

This project compares the forecasting performance of ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet models on Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) daily stock prices from 2018 to 2023. Using historical data sourced via yfinance, the models were evaluated based on predictive accuracy (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²), computational efficiency, and adaptability to market volatility. Feature engineering incorporated technical indicators like Moving Average (MA20), RSI, and MACD to enhance predictions. An interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed to allow users to select stocks, visualize model forecasts, generate buy/sell signals, and backtest trading strategies using Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown metrics. Results showed that LSTM achieved the highest predictive performance, while ARIMA provided a strong baseline for stable stocks, and Prophet offered a simple, interpretable solution but struggled in volatile conditions. This project demonstrates real-world applications for financial forecasting, investment decision-making, and trading strategy optimization.
